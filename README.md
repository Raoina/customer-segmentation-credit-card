# üß† Customer Segmentation for Credit Card Customers

## üìå Project Overview

This project aims to segment customers based on their **credit card usage behavior** using unsupervised learning techniques. The dataset provides detailed financial activities and habits of customers, such as purchase types, payment patterns, cash advances, and credit limits.

By analyzing and clustering the data, we aim to:
- Understand customer behaviors and patterns.
- Identify key customer segments.
- Provide business insights to improve marketing strategies, risk management, and customer engagement.

## üéØ Business Objective

The core objective of this analysis is to **help the business understand its customers better**, so they can:
- Target high-value customers with personalized offers.
- Reduce risk by identifying potentially risky users (e.g., frequent cash advances).
- Improve customer retention by understanding long-term loyal users.
